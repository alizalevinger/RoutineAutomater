# RoutineAutomater
Build desirable habits by creating and tracking daily routines

RoutineAutomater is an Android App that will allow the user to create a routine list of tasks and track their completion daily. Suitable for all ages.

USE CASE: Andrew is 6 years old and would like to plan a Bedtime Routine together with his mom. They would like to create individual tasks such as brushing teeth, changing into pjs, etc and check them off one by one until the list is complete. This will enable Andrew to remain on task and complete his pre-bed tasks without constant badgering from his mom.

USE CASE: Megan is 27 and would like to build a Fitness Routine to help her exercise daily. Ideally, she would like to plan several different routines: a Cardio Routine, a Yoga Routine, a Weightlifting Routine, and an at-home Rainy Day Routine. Aside from building these task lists and checking off her goals each day, she would like to be able to track which Routines she has completed on which dates, as well as which tasks she has completed, assuming she has not completed them all.
